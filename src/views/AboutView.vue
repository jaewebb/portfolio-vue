      <div>
        <p>
          I've always had a passion for web design and technology.
          In my early teens,
          I would play around with layouts on social media websites,
          create pixel art, and design simple graphics for use online.
          My interest in these domains continued into high school,
          where I focused on programming and design courses,
          and eventually led me to study
          Computer Science at the University of Guelph.
        </p>

        <p>
          After two years of obtaining foundational knowledge
          in computer programming and UI design at the University of Guelph,
          I decided that the practical application offered by college
          would be a better fit for my personal career goals.
          I chose to study Computer Programming at Conestoga College,
          where I spent 3 years (and 2 co-op work terms)
          acquiring technical skills in languages such as
          C#, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.
        </p>

        <p>
          After graduating, I acquired professional web experience
          working with C#, ASP.NET MVC, and React.
          In recent years, most of my time has been spent
          using Vue.js and an internal design framework,
          but I&apos;ve also gained valuable experience with
          Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.
        </p>

        <h6>My career goals are:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>To never stop learning</li>
          <li>To foster and express my natural creativity through my work</li>
          <li>
            To build and create beautiful,
            useful web apps that I can be proud of
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To achieve my goals,
          I work on personal projects and watch training videos in my off hours.
          I take pride in the quality of my work,
          and strive to produce the best product possible for my employers
          - I am happy to say that previous employers have been
          more than satisfied with the results!
